# syllabus.csl
A custon CSL style for including Zotero items on my course syllabus in a friendly, non-citationy format.

Basically, I don't want to clutter my syllabus with bibliograpic information undergrads don't care about, and which, frankly, I don't either in this context. All I really want is the author, date, and title. And URL if that exists. And I want the name in a more informal firstname lastname format. Kind of like this:

* Jill Walker, "Distributed Narrative: Telling Stories across Networks" (2014)

I was sick of exporting sources from Zotero in Chicago or MLA format, and then manually editing the citation in WordPress, Word, or wherever I was writing. So I started modifying the file of an existing CSL (the MLA's 8th edition style). It's a work in progress. CSL blows my mind. Much different from when I used to edit Endnote citation styles 20 years ago. The CSL visual editor is invaluable: http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/.

Please fork, customize, improve, etc.! I'll happily approve any pull requests that fit my simple needs for this citation style.
